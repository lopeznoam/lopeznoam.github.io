	"Insecurity and Perception of Insecurity in Lima, Peru" is a working paper published in "Cuadernos de 
	Investigación", a  working papers series of the Public Opinion Institute of the Pontifical Catholic
	University of Peru.

 Abstract
 
	This research compares the levels of insecurity with the perception of insecurity in Metropolitan Lima, Peru.
	As citizen insecurity is one of the main problems that the population perceives, Lima has been chosen due to 
	its high concentration of property crimes registered in Peru. This research attempts to determine how the 
	complaints of robbery and theft have varied as well as to observe changes in the perception of insecurity at 
	the district level. As a methodology, it has employed a composite indicator of perceived insecurity using a 
	multivariate statistical technique named exploratory factor analysis (EFA) based on the information gathered 
	by the Instituto de Opinion Pública (IOP) of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru during 2007-2010. This
	research concludes that victimization and perception of insecurity are two different phenomena. To show the 
	findings the composite indicators are geo-referenced. Additionally, this contrast is studied in depth using
	data from Lima Cercado, a historical district of Metropolitan Lima.

 Key words
 
	Lima, citizen security, perception of insecurity, violent crime, fear of crime, 
	exploratory factor analysis.
